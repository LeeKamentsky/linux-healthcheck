# linux-healthcheck
This package is a placeholder for whatever health checks I'd like to perform
daily on whatever Linux machines I have lying around. For instance, a box
has been experiencing some correctable memory errors and I'd like to get a
daily report on that.

Reports are delivered by email when some notable change occurs.
